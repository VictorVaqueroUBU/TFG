   abstract = {"This extraordinary book shows a new way to simplify your life and work, increase your focus, and get more done in less time than you ever thought possible."-Brian Tracy, bestselling author of Eat That Frog! and Time Power "Groundbreaking … Will upend people's assumptions about how productive they can actually be.… Jeff Sutherland discloses to the non-tech world the elegantly simple process that programmers and web developers have been using since he invented Scrum, showing how a small, empowered, and dedicated team can deliver significantly higher quality work at a faster pace through introspection, iteration, and adaptation."-Michael Mangi, senior VP of interactive technology, Social@Ogilvy "Jeff Sutherland has written the essence of Scrum for the masses. This book elevates Scrum from a fix-it tool to a way of life."-Hirotaka Takeuchi, professor of management practice, Harvard Business School "Jeff Sutherland is the master of creating high-performing teams. The subtitle of this book understates Scrum's impact. If you don't get three times the results in one-third the time, you aren't doing it right!"-Scott Maxwell, founder and senior managing director, OpenView Venture Partners "Jeff Sutherland used the common-sense but seldom-applied principles of the quality movement, user-centered design, and lean development to come up with a process that dramatically increases productivity while reducing employees' frustrations with the typical corporate nonsense. This book is the best description I've seen of how this process can work across many industries."},
